HOW TO SET UP YOUR WORKSPACE --------------------
- You can download this code and work on it using any editor, but it might be hard to push it to github then.
- How I've been doing it:
    - Download VS Code
    - Download NVM -> install NPM and Node.js
    - Install git w this: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- You can create your own branch with its own branches to merge to, before you create a pull request to pull to the master.
